Translate the survey app to Spring Shell

Goal: After completing home work, you will be able to use Spring Shell to write the application interface without the Web. 

Result: Application on Spring Shell

The homework assignment is based on the previous one.

Necessary:

Connect the Spring Shell using spring-starter.
Write a set of commands that allows you to conduct a survey.
Write Unit tests using spring-boot-starter-test, take into account that Spring Shell should be disabled in tests.

The set of commands depends only on your desire. You can make a single command that runs your Main, or you can build a full-fledged interface on the Spring Shell.

You DO NOT NEED to localize Spring Shell commands (although you can, but it is long and difficult).
