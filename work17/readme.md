Rewrite the application using AJAX and REST controllers
Goal: use Spring MVC to develop modern AJAX / SPA applications using Spring MVC
Result: a modern application on the Spring stack
The homework assignment is based on the previous one.

1. Rewrite the application from the classic View to the AJAX architecture and REST controllers.
2. Minimum: getting one entity and displaying it on the page using XMLHttpRequest, fetch api, or jQuery
3. Optional maximum: full-fledged SPA application on React/Vue/Angular, only REST controllers.

In the case of SPA development, it is recommended to move the repository from the front-end. Use a proxy when developing (there should be no CORS settings).
