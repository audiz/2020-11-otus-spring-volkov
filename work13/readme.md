Use MongoDB and spring-data to store book information
Goal: After completing the home work, you will be able to use Spring Data MongoDB and MongoDB itself to develop applications with data stored in a non-relational database.
Result: Application using MongoDB
The task can be performed based on the previous one, or it can be performed independently

Requirements:
1. Use Spring Data MongoDB repositories, and if there is not enough functionality, then *Operations
2. Tests can be implemented using Flapdoodle Embedded MongoDB
3. Hibernate, as well as JPA, and spring-boot-starter-data-jpa should not remain in dependencies if the home work is executed based on the previous one.
4. How to store books, authors, genres, and comments is up to you. But the structure transferred from the relational database will not always be suitable for MongoDB.
