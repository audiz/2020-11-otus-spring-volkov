CRUD application with Web UI and database storage
Goal: to develop full-fledged classic Web applications
Result: The Web application is completely on the Spring stack
Necessary:
1. Create an application with storing entities in the database (you can take the library and DAO / repositories from previous classes)
2. Use the classic View on Thymeleaf, classic Controllers.
3. For books (the main entity), all CRUD operations must be available on the UI. CRUD of other entities - optional/necessary.
4. Localization is NOT necessary - it is strictly optional.
