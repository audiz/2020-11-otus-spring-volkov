A library based on Spring Data JPA
Goal: as simple as possible to write a repository layer using modern approaches
Result: an application with a repository layer on Spring Data JPA
The homework is done by rewriting the previous one in JPA.

Requirements:
1. Rewrite all the repositories for working with books to Spring Data JPA repositories.
2. Use spring-boot-starter-data-jpa.
3. Custom repository methods (or with the tricky @Query) to cover with tests using H2.
4. @Transactional is recommended to put on the methods of services, not repositories.
