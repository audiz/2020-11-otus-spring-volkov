Use WebFlux
Goal: Goal: Develop Responsive and Resilient applications on the Spring reactive stack using Spring Web Flux and Reactive Spring Data Repositories
Result: application on the Spring reactive stack
1. As a basis for performing the work, you can take a home work with Ajax + REST (it is better not to use a classic web application for this).
2. But you can choose a different domain model (not a library).
3. You must use the Reactive Spring Data Repositories.
4. It is better to use MongoDB or Redis as a database. It is not recommended to use PostgreSQL and experimental R2DBC.
5. RxJava vs Project Reactor-to your taste.
6. Instead of the classic Spring MVC and embedded Web server, use WebFlux.
7. Optional: Implement on Functional Endpoints
