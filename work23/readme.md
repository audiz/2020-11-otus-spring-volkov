Add an authentication mechanism to the CRUD Web application
Goal: Protect the Web application with authentication and simple authorization
Result: an application using Spring Security
Attention! The task is based on a non-active Sping MVC application!

1. Add a new user entity to the application. It is not necessary to implement methods for creating users - you can add users only through DB scripts.
2. Add a Form-based authentication mechanism to the existing CRUD application.
3. Implement UsersServices yourself.
4. Authorization on all pages - for all authenticated ones. Login form-available to everyone.
